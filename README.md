### Passion Project    
I enjoy teaching and working with parents to help them meet the educational needs of their children. The church I attend has a partner church in Mexico. Two summers ago, I went on a mission trip to Mexico City sponsored by my church. I taught English through games to the kids who attended our summer camp and conducted a Reading workshop for parents.

### Weekly Reflections

### Week One  
As a new Java student, I learned this week that there is much to learn. The readings in the text and tutorials on Lynda have been helpful.

### Week Two
After watching a few tutorials about Intelij, I am much more comfortable working with the IDE. 

### Week Three 
There has been a lot of material covered and concepts to take in over the last three weeks. This week things are beginning to make 
more sense.  Now when I read or reread the chapters assigned for homework, the concepts are much clearer.


### Week Four
This week the trip to FatPipe provided an opportunity to start networking with some of the people who attended. It also gave me a chance to "try on" my new identity as a developer.  It was a little strange at first, but got easier with each person I interacted with.  It was a great opportunity.


### Week Five
This week was a turning point.  The material is making more sense as we work through the in-class projects. I am also making reasonable progress on finding resources for my personal android project.
