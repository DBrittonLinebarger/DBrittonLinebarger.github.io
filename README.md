### Passion Project    
I enjoy teaching and working with parents to help them meet the educational needs of their children. The church I attend has a partner church in Mexico. Two summers ago, I went on a mission trip to Mexico City sponsored by my church. I taught English through games to the kids who attended our summer camp and conducted a Reading workshop for parents.
